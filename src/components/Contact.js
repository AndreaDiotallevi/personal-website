          I am a full-stack software developer and creative coder based in
          London, UK.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I have expertise in designing, implementing, and maintaining
          full-stack applications with proficiency in Node, React, Python, Git,
          CI/CD, and RESTful APIs. I have also experience collaborating in
          modern software methodologies like test-driven development, pair
          programming, code reviews and AGILE.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a pianist and former architect, I am also fascinated by the
          intersection between art and technology and I am in constant
          exploration of generative art concepts. For each new work, I design a
          custom algorithm capable of generating a sequence of unique, but
          aesthetically related images.
